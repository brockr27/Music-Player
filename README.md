Doing changes:

1. Open git bash and navigate to the folder (type "git cd whatever/your/path/is)
2. You can type "git status" to view the status (you don't have to though)
3. Type "git add ." (or if you know the specific file you've changed you can type "git add file/path/name")
4. Type "git commit -m "Info about you change"" (You'll see something like "2 files changed, 1 insertion, 1 deletion" or something)
5. Type "git push --all" (You'll see a lot of text and progress percents)
6. Done

Creating a new branch:
1. git checkout -b [nameOfBranch] // creates and switches to a new branch
2. git push origin [nameOfBranch] // pushes the new branch to github
